### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur based out of Bangalore, India. I code in Python professionally and dabble with Golang and some Js/Ts bits as a hobby. Experienced in building backend systems from the ground up across B2B SaaS platforms and B2C mobile apps. Big fan of Manchester United.
